2/21/2015 -> 2/27/2015

Distributed networking
	Transition to decentralized/centralized network
	Players must keep their civilization nodes together or face penalties
	> Discourage founding cities far away and tight defenses
	Fields and improvements act as minor nodes
		Addition of hamlets as minor nodes (which require maintenance?)
AI changes
	AI should optimize fields
	AI prioritizes war when army is strong
Dynamic culture shifting
	If a tile is surrounded by many others, shift culture gradually
	Allow players to buy tiles
Sieges like in RTW and Endless Legend
		
2/14/2015 -> 2/20/2015 (More hackathon work)

A new UI that emphasizes icons and only shows text in tooltips
Menu dialogs and ledgers that sort
Put action/status bar in a permanent location
	Remove for now

Scaling resources to empire size and turns
/ New streamlined UI that reflects Endless Legend
	>+ Icons in queue menu
	>+ Changes to yield GUI
Grand view perspective, strategic mid-view, detailed view
	Variable positions of mouse clicking (define how to click a tile based on a rendering)
Work on and balance unit upgrades (some disadvantages and costs)
> Tech tree visualization
	Variable tech trees? (group by strategy i.e. militaristic techs unlock others of the same type)
Dynamic city model
	3d models when queuing
Levels when building cities, fields, units
	Improvements and cities (like Boroughs in Endless Legend)
	Techs 
> Add more game icons
	> Change FGMR gui
	> Unit improvement icons
	Get building, other unit improvement icons
	> Combat GUI
>+ Fixed row column order in GUI
>+ New minimap
>+ Yield GUI with reasons

> Use of hashmaps to explain how yields are calculated (e.g. in index "+1 from coal" put "+1 production"
Constitution stat (i.e. morale) for units
Strategy conduciveness (e.g. more horsemen if majority of tiles are steppe)
	Encourage player to take strategy through quest (but not all the time)
Increase resources (e.g. allow player to breed animals by not harvesting them, a gamble)
	Allow players to spend resources on a dig which may provide coal for a limited time
	Discourage resource rushing
	Do not use randomness or other arbitrary factors
Lower the number of tile evaluations by saving them every turn
	
2/7/2015 -> 2/13/2015 (Hackathon work)

The idea that every single island is a world, and civilizations can establish colonies in other worlds
Colonization as a possible mid-to-late-game mechanic
	- Colonies require upkeep to survive
	- Cost increases exponentially with number of colonies (EU4, Civ: BE)
	Inland vs overseas colony
		Settler acts as settler on connected territory, colonizer on far away territory
	
/ Implement fields
	Allow AI to optimize fields
	> Allow player to buy and improve fields through menu
	> Calculate effects of fields on tile production
	Allow player to increase centralization of fields with centralization tech
Implement trade routes/caravans
	Allow caravans to be unlocked by tech
	Factor caravans into tile production
> Allow workers to build roads, which connect cities	
	> Give bonus to movement, trade route effectiveness
/ Better UI/graphics
	Gradient buttons with consistent theme
	/ Textured graphics (either randomly generated in program or TerraGen)
	/ Ability to view a tile's fields through tactical menu
		>+ Field menu allows one to edit fields
	> Ability to see how improvements easy yield
	> Tooltips for building queue menu
	>+ Tooltips for researching tech
	Encyclopedia entries
	Advanced tutorial on economics, war, etc.
	> Fix tile yield GUI so that it does not overlap
	/ Rough and smooth textures for terrain
	>+ City growth and production GUI
	>+ Addition of tutorial menu (multiple tutorials)
/ Bug fixes
	> Cancel movement order if next tile is within enemy territory
	Check if units are in enemy territory and push them out
	>+ Fixed worker causing infinite loop
	
/ Game balancing (to be done 2/9/2015)
	>+ Factor in gold
	>+ Reduce population growth by making it an exponential function

1/19/2015 -> 1/24/2015

> Streamlined UI
	> Use royalty free icons from favorited website
	X Rearrange buttons for menus to be in a row on the bottom
Graphics/UX
	Add textures to terrain
		Possible use of TerraGen
	Smooth terrain (no implementation details yet)

		http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/box-filtering-height-maps-for-smooth-rolling-hills-r2164
Balancing

Fields
	/ Implement multiple fields per tile
		Allow player to buy fields with gold or culture
		Allow AI to optimize fields of a tile
	> Implement owners of tiles
		> Randomly generate an owner for a field
			Tributary fields -> provide resources for any civ that owns the tile, can be converted into civ field (less autonomy)
			X Unowned fields -> provide larger amount of resources when improvement is built
			Barbarian fields -> openly hostile fields, equivalent to savage field but can spawn a barbarian revolt
			Savage fields -> must be converted to tributary fields by force or culture
			Civilization fields -> directly owned by a civilization (converted from unowned)
	Fields can improve a tile's yield
	/ Field autonomy
		Percentage which determines amount of resources given
		A field is left autonomous -> may turn into city state (cannot be captured)
	Fields can be captured by warring civs
City-states
	Addition of non-capturable city states
		Revert to tributary field on tile when captured
	
(Planned 12/1/2014 -> 12/12/2014) 

/+ Game mechanic balancing
	AI should improve units when available to discourage spamming weaker units
		Melee units have weapon improvement that gives advantage over enemy unit lacking it
	AI should explore more and pathfind to enemies directly (omnisciently) on harder difficulty
	Increase costs of all "late-game" units such as swordsman
	/ Integrate other tile improvements into game such as windmill, mine, etc
	Focus on tile improvements early-game and let AI research techs that exploit resources
	>+ Food and metal production per-city only
	Limit number of units spawned by AI and barbarians
	> Add health system to city that ranged strength relies on; capture at 0 health
+ Graphics changes
	/ Add more detail to terrain (possible use of textures)
	> Tile yields shown in 2D GUI
	>+ Streamlined UI
		>+ Flashing button (use stroke) instead of changing button width
		/+ Rearrange elements to specifications in notebook
		>+ Tooltip of a unit's name that is highlighted by mouse (e.g. Athenian worker, Cretan warrior, etc.)
		>+ Pauses between automatic selection (of units) which can be set in menu
		+ Gradient colors for UI buttons
	/+ City GUI for queued food, metal, and health + estimated turns to production
	>+ Status bar (tell player what needs to be queued)
>+ Fixed sea land border glitch
>+ Fixed glitch in 2D tile gui
>+ Balanced forests, small changes

+ Savages that prevent working of certain tiles (have no presence on map)
	+ Can turn into barbarians
+ City names for each civilization
